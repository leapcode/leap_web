  # This test is nice and clean but also a bit fragile:
  # RackTest assumes all requests to be local. So we need
  # BraintreeTestApp for the braintree transparent redirect to work.
  #
  # this mystifies me why this works. when i type the click_button line (and the
  # customer.braintree_customer line) in the debugger, it gives a timeout,
  # but it works fine embedded in the test.
