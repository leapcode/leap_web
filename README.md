LEAP Web
---------------------
___________________
| This is retired |
-------------------

The LEAP Web App provides the following functions:

* User registration and management
* Help tickets
* Client certificate renewal
* Webfinger access to user’s public keys
* Email aliases and forwarding
* Localized and Customizable documentation
* Display of status updates from Twitter (access to tweets via Twitter API)

Written in: Ruby, Rails.

The Web App communicates with:

* CouchDB is used for all data storage.
* Web browsers of users accessing the user interface in order to edit their settings or fill out help tickets. Additionally, admins may delete users.
* LEAP Clients access the web app’s REST API in order to register new users, authenticate existing ones, and renew client certificates.
* tokens are stored upon successful authentication to allow the client to authenticate against other services

LEAP Web is provisioned and run as part of the overall [LEAP platform](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform).

Installation
---------------------------

Typically, this application is installed automatically as part of the
LEAP Platform. To install it manually for testing or development, follow
these instructions:

### Install system requirements

You'll need git, ruby (2.1.5), couchdb and bundler installed.
On a recent debian based distribution run

    sudo apt install git ruby couchdb bundler

For other operation systems please lookup the install instructions of these
tools.

To run the tests you also need to be able to install the nokogiri gem.
Nokogiri needs to be compiled during installation and thus has some more
dependencies. On debian run:

    sudo apt install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev

On other systems you might have to look up instructions at
  http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html


### Download source

We host our own git repository. In order to create a local clone run

    git clone --recursive git://leap.se/leap_web
    cd leap_web

The repo is mirrored on github and we accept pull requests there:

  https://github.com/leapcode/leap_web

### Install required ruby libraries

    bundle

Typically, you run ``bundle`` as a normal user and it will ask you for a
sudo password when it is time to install the required gems. If you don't
have sudo, run ``bundle`` as root.

### Installation for development purposes

Please see `doc/DEVELOP.md` for details about installing
leap_web for development purposes.

Configuration for Production
----------------------------

The configuration file `config/defaults.yml` provides good defaults for
most values. You can override these defaults by creating a file
`config/config.yml`.

There are a few values you should make sure to modify:

    production:
      admins: ["myusername","otherusername"]
      domain: example.net
      force_ssl: true
      secret_key_base: "e1c04f93edb26b64040ba49f34084b03abbc286a7fbb60b5b0736bed2d9fe3ec5f16ef4253b252080f3c8b52e11541d57adc8eee6e4bd53f3b568aced3455106"
      client_ca_key: "./test/files/ca.key"
      client_ca_cert: "./test/files/ca.key"
      ca_key_password: nil

* `admins` is an array of usernames that are granted special admin
   privilege.

* `domain` is your fully qualified domain name.

* `force_ssl`, if set to true, will require secure cookies and turn on
   HSTS. Don't do this if you are using a self-signed server certificate.

* `secret_key_base`, used for cookie security, you can create one with
  `rake secret`. Should be at least 64 bytes hex.

* `client_ca_key`, the private key of the CA used to generate client
   certificates.

* `client_ca_cert`, the public certificate the CA used to generate client
   certificates.

* `ca_key_password`, used to unlock the client_ca_key, if needed.

Running
-----------------------------

To run leap_web:

    cd leap_web
    bin/rake db:rotate
    bin/rake db:migrate
    bin/rails server

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

When running in development mode, you can login with administrative
powers by creating an account with username 'staff', 'blue', or 'red'
(configured in config/default.yml).

To peruse the database, visit http://localhost:5984/_utils/

The task `db:rotate` must come before `db:migrate`, in order to assure that
the special rotating databases get created.

Do not run the normal CouchRest task 'couchrest:migrate'. Instead, use
'db:rotate' since the latter will correctly use the couchdb.admin.yml file.

Testing
--------------------------------

To run all tests

    bin/rake RAILS_ENV=test db:rotate    # if not already run
    bin/rake RAILS_ENV=test db:migrate   # if not already run
    bin/rake test

To run an individual test:

    rake test TEST=certs/test/unit/client_certificate_test.rb
    or
    ruby -Itest certs/test/unit/client_certificate_test.rb

Known problems
---------------------------

* Client certificates are generated without a CSR. The problem is that
  this makes the web application extremely vulnerable to denial of
  service attacks. This is not an issue unless the provider enables the
  possibility of anonymously fetching a client certificate without
  authenticating first.

* By its very nature, the user database is vulnerable to enumeration
  attacks. These are very hard to prevent, because our protocol is
  designed to allow query of a user database via proxy in order to
  provide network perspective.
